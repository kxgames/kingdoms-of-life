; Welcome to the INI file for the unit balance tool!
; Keep in mind that unit attacking AI is still being worked on, so take any results with plenty of salt.

; NOTE: Missiles and non-attacking types are not valid combats and will be skipped.
; NOTE: Also, if one side is land and the other sea, the combat will be run only if the max_range of the land
; NOTE: type is greater than or equal to the max_range of the sea type (else the sea type would never be hit--a pointless sim)
