    <!--;Terrain Groupings
;
; Amounts & distances scaled to (four player) map size.
; Best to place the terrain features that are most important towards the top of the list
; note that the terrain is initially filled with fertile...fertile groups can be dropped, but may not do anything
; Min/Max size, Min/Max groupings can be scaled for map size by saying '3 SCALE' to scale with
; the axis length, or '3 AREA' to scale with the map area
;
; Type          = Terrain Type [Forest, Rocks, Mountains]
; %         = % Chance to have group
; Group     = Group # (sequential items w/ same group use same random #)
; Min #     = number of clumps to place (per player if pattern indicates, otherwise in total, negative = times number of players)
; Max #     = number of clumps to place (per player if pattern indicates, otherwise in total, negative = times number of players)
; Pattern   = 0->per player 1->per continent 2->in world 3->in world, but not on a continent with a player
; MinSize       = Minimum clump size- for mountains or cliffs, use 1, 2, 3 to specify small, med, large
; MaxSize       = Maximum clump size- for mountains or cliffs, use 1, 2, 3 to specify small, med, large
; Near      = nearest distance allowed to player start locations
; Far       = furthest distance allowed from player start locations- only applies to 'per player' pattern
; Space     = 0->allow this group to join onto others 1->place this group with a 1 spacing around it
; CoastSpace= 0->allow this group to be next to a coast 1-> force 1 space between this group and the coast
;  = nearest distance allowed to center of map - does not apply for 'per player' or 'per continent' patterns- 0 to not check this
;    = furthest distance allowed from center of map - does not apply for 'per player' or 'per continent' patterns- 0 1 to not check this
; CliffFace = how to orient cliffs with a 'per player' pattern.  0 = defend toward center of map  1 = defend toward center of all players  2= anything goes

; note: if placing trees per player, only odd #'s of tiles are allowed to make sure there is a x6 spot somewhere on the clump
