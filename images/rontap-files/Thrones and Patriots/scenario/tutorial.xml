    <INTRO>The First World War has left Europe decimated and bankrupt. In Germany, domestic upheavals trigger the rise of extreme nationalism, and the German war machine is rebuilt.

For the second time in a quarter-century, a world war erupts, one that is destined to be more terrible than the first.</INTRO>
