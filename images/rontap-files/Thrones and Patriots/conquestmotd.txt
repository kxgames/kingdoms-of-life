^Army Movement Rules
^ -Each army is allowed to move one space per turn in lieu of making an attack
^ -Armies that have moved DO participate in battles as support armies if their move puts them in position
^ -If you move all your armies or your moves make further moves or attacks impossible, the turn ends
^ -After your army has moved, it turns away from you to signify that it can make no more moves
^
^Overrun outmatched territories!
^ -If you can maneuver your armies so that you have two more armies than your opponent in support of a battle,
^  you automatically win and get another chance to attack

^Armies do even more things
^ -Your main army gives you units to start out with... supporting armies coming soon
^ -In Barbarian scenarios, you may start with different #'s of units, but you'll always have your army.
^ -Armies retreat when defeated... but if they're boxed in, they're destroyed
^  -Ability to choose your retreat coming soon
^Building Chings
^ -For each turn that you've owned a territory, you start with more buildings in your city
^ -4 different levels in at the moment
^ -Additional cities coming soon

^WEEK BEGINNING 9.10.2002 - ABOVE
^
^Armies that do things
^ -Attacking is possible only from areas with armies
^ -Armies can be moved anywhere in friendly territory for now
^ -Capture supply depots to get armies.  If you have an option, it prompts you for placement.
^ -Advancing / Retreating doesn't really work
^9.5- Interim checkin- There are now pieces on the board, but the old game is mostly intact
^
^The conquest game is under heavy construction right now... enter at your own risk.
