		<STRING hash="110630">Hi</STRING>
		<STRING hash="436030197">We have no interest in negotiating with you. All we need to do is conquer your nation and the world will be ours.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="258162342">There is no need for a peace agreement between us since we are already allies.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="70035668">Yes, let us end this terrible war!</STRING>
		<STRING hash="195097471">Very well. We will end this war and sign your peace treaty.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="201587037">All right, we need some time to prepare for a new assault as well.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="178986281">Yes, we agree. Peace is in the best interests of everyone.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="196830738">These are excellent terms! We will agree to this peace treaty.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="282812868">Perhaps it would be better if we negotiated peace before talking about alliances.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="172406433">No thank you. We have enough allies at the moment.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="359222075">We had been considering a similar offer to yours. We believe our nations will work well together.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="60219225">Yes! Who shall we destroy first?</STRING>
		<STRING hash="254952077">Yes! Now no one will be able to stop the $s0! Oh, um, I mean the $s0 and the $s1!</STRING>
		<STRING hash="186030804">These are excellent terms! We will agree to this alliance.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="218383423">We are going to need at least this much Tribute if you want our help.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="198630764">That is a paltry sum to offer us. We need something more like this.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="189366780">We will not sign an alliance for anything less than this.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="179942468">Yes. Who would not want to join with your great nation?</STRING>
		<STRING hash="224646203">Your offer is a fair one, and our armies will now march alongside yours.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="113867821">We needed a change of government anyway.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="90672259">We agree. Who do we have to kill first?</STRING>
		<STRING hash="172654211">That is a fair offer. We will become your vassal.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="217783634">You have nothing to offer us that will make us give up our independence.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="337312105">We will never sell our nation for so little. You do not have enough to interest us at present.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="193379578">Well, we have always considered your land ours anyway.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="174869181">We appreciate this gesture. It saves us a lot of time.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="331136588">Even though we are at war, we are willing to make a deal, but only according to our terms.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="66330431">This is a fair trade. We accept.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="115481436">This deal seems more than fair. No refunds!</STRING>
		<STRING hash="112094490">Very well, I suppose we can agree to this.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="187273799">Well, if this is the best you can do, I guess we can agree.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="42164205">This seems fair. I accept.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="243571091">No, that is not fair to our nation. We believe it should be something like this.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="203467566">We do not agree to your offer, but perhaps you will agree to this?</STRING>
		<STRING hash="116271759">That was a good offer. Here's a better one.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="205021505">That deal does not seem fair to us. Consider this proposal instead.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="93816062">We accept your Tribute with gratitude.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="22201777">Thank you very much!</STRING>
		<STRING hash="178969743">And you want nothing in return? Well, OK, if you say so.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="427861469">Your gift comes at the perfect time! Now we can upgrade our Capital's defenses and make it invulnerable.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="165086851">Our leader is always happy to accept such gifts.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="114859917">We yield. We will pay this tribute to you.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="206629898">We feel it would be prudent to give in to your demands at this time.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="57888995">OK! OK! Please don't squash us.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="182815262">Why should we pay you? If anything, you should pay us!</STRING>
		<STRING hash="200999449">This is outrageous! We will never acquiesce to such extortion.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="115462695">Is this a joke? You are kidding, aren't you?</STRING>
		<STRING hash="180435386">We will not give up our freedom for such a paltry sum.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="254456942">You will have to give us much more than that if you expect us to listen to you.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="192455612">Our great nation will never bow before the boot of tyranny.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="311983950">Why would we agree to peace? We have so much yet to gain from the spoils of your country.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="76264722">Only a fool would sign that treaty!</STRING>
		<STRING hash="134021399">Only your utter destruction will end this war.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="243319077">We are not as weak as you, and we will see this war through until the very end.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="174500249">We do not see how this benefits us. Our answer is no.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="368368031">Our great nation has no need to ally with the likes of you. Besides, we enjoy trampling the weak.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="621766239">Under different circumstances we might have welcomed an alliance with you. Unfortunately for you, that means we cannot accept your offer.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="402888531">Your nation is not capable of offering serious help to anybody. We have no time for the likes of you.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="199708652">Come back in a few turns when you have things that interest us.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="164281389">You do not have enough to interest us at present.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="87034289">This deal would be more to our liking.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="186271542">Unfortunately you have nothing of interest to us at present.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="221083251">You will need to find more to offer us if you want us to agree to deal.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="183994371">Conquer more territories and maybe then we will negotiate.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="268324888">There is nothing you presently have that would compell us to sign that agreement.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="152117702">Are you here to negotiate, or to waste our time?</STRING>
		<STRING hash="207952698">We tire of your games. Offer us a real proposal, or be done with it!</STRING>
		<STRING hash="267330760">Apparently negotiation is not one of the finer points of education in your nation.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="439121001">We did not come here to play around. If this is the best you can offer, then perhaps we should end these negotiations.</STRING>
		<STRING hash="207300490">That is one of the worst offers I have ever seen. Is it some kind of joke?</STRING>
