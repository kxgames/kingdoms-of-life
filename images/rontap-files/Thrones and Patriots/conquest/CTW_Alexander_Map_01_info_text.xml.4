		<ENTRY name="THE SIEGE OF TYRE">
			<STRING>After winning the battle of Issus, Alexander turned southwest in order to consolidate the coastline and deny the Persian and Cyprian fleets safe haven and a base from which to attack Greece. Sidon and Byblus surrendered. Tyre refused Alexander entrance to the city, yet to subdue this island fortress was a necessity, for the Macedonians could not advance to Egypt or pursue Darius while the Persians controlled the sea. <SPACE/>Considering that Alexander did not have a fleet equal to that of the Phoenicians, the siege and capture of Tyre’s walled city, which was on an island separated from the mainland by over half a mile, was perhaps Alexander's greatest military achievement. In a combined naval and land siege, the Macedonians built a mole, or land bridge, that spanned the half-mile to the island. Alexander isolated the Tyrian fleet, and by the use of towers and siege weapons eventually breached the apparently insurmountable walls of the city. Though the siege was long and arduous, Tyre's fall gave the Macedonians control of Syria, Egypt, and more importantly, naval control of the eastern Mediterranean. </STRING>

			<STRING>Alexander’s army, now sporting a somewhat international demeanor due to the addition of soldiers from many of the nations he had conquered, entered India in 327 B.C. In June of 326, after receiving supplies and reinforcements from the king of the Taxilans, his troops arrived on the banks of the river Hydaspes. There Alexander found the army of Paurava waiting, led by their king, Porus. Porus, who was reportedly seven feet tall, had a large, well-trained army, including a weapon that the Macedonians had probably not encountered before: war elephants, of which Porus had 200. After fording the river in a violent thunderstorm, Alexander's troops defeated Porus and his elephants in a fierce battle. Porus was wounded and captured, but no enemy had inflicted more casualties upon the Macedonian army than he had. Alexander was a man who loved warfare more than anything; in characteristic fashion, rather than be infuriated by Porus’ combat skill, he had the greatest respect for his vanquished foe.<SPACE/>After the battle, Alexander met his prisoner. He said to Porus,  "What do you wish that I should do with you?" To this Porus responded, "Treat me as a king ought." Alexander promised to do so, but then said, "Is there not something you would wish for yourself? Ask it."<SPACE/>History has not forgotten the reply of Porus: "Everything is contained in this one request." Alexander was so pleased with this response that, rather than imprisoning Porus, he returned all his lands to him and restored him as king.</STRING>

		<ENTRY name="BARBARIANS OF THRACE">
			<STRING>Ancient Thrace occupied most of the area known today as the nation of Bulgaria, as well as parts of other countries, including Greece, Turkey, and Romania. It was a densely-populated state for its time; during the era of Alexander, there may have been a million Thracians while the population of the Greek city-states numbered no more than 250,000. Herodotus, the Greek historian who is known alternately as “the Father of History” and "the Father of Lies," was from Thrace. Probably the most famous Thracian was Spartacus, who precipitated a revolt of Roman slaves in 73 B.C. that threatened to topple the powerful Roman republic. <SPACE/>In war, Thracians were noted for their courage and resourcefulness, and Thracian peltasts were prized as mercenary soldiers for centuries. By the end of 342 B.C., Alexander's father, Philip II, had conquered all of Thrace. It was conquered again by the Romans in 46 B.C., in the campaign in which Spartacus was captured. The bulk of Thrace was assimilated into Bulgaria in the seventh century. </STRING>

			<STRING>In the fall of 325 B.C., Alexander embarked upon what, in many ways, was one of his most dangerous campaigns--not because of the threat from any human adversaries, but from Nature herself. After years of campaigning, he was finally taking his army home to Macedonia, but in typical Alexandrian fashion, he wanted to do things with flair. Against the advice of his generals, he chose to march part of his army across the inhospitable sands of the Gedrosian Desert, rather than put them aboard ship with the rest of his troops. Alexander did this specifically because no man had ever crossed this desert with an army successfully. A queen named Semiramis had accomplished the feat in theory, though with only 20 survivors out of her entire army. Cyrus the Great of Persia had made it through the desert too, but with only seven men, which isn't quite enough to call an “army.”<SPACE/>In any case, the survivors of Alexander’s army eventually made it through the desert, and Alexander had a final triumph… of sorts. Nearly three-quarters of Alexander's troops had perished in the desert, victims of hostile human and animal inhabitants, heat, starvation, and thirst.</STRING>

He broke the famous Sacred Band of Thebes which, according to legend, was the first time anybody had ever dared to charge horsemen against them. His success helped his father Philip II defeat the Athenians and their allies and establish Macedonian rule over Greece.<SPACE/>When Philip died in 336 B.C., the Greek city-states that he had conquered rejoiced, certain that this event portended the end of Macedonian rule of Greece. There was little belief that a mere boy (as the Greeks perceived Alexander) would be able to hold together the empire that Philip had forged.<SPACE/>The Athenians, the Aetolians, the Thebans, the Spartans and other Peloponnesians, were all more than ready to declare their independence. Alexander knew that he had to act swiftly to prevent the dissolution of his extended realm. A false rumor spread through Greece like wildfire that Alexander had died at the hands of Illyrian rebels, and the Thebans rose in revolt. Athens and the other Greek city-states, though sympathetic to Thebes, waited to see what Alexander would do.<SPACE/>What he did was to embark upon a lightning campaign, marching his forces almost 240 miles in 14 days, to appear before the gates of rebellious Thebes. Thebes stood defiant, refusing to surrender, so Alexander sacked the city, killing or enslaving its more than 30,000 inhabitants.<SPACE/>Civilized Greece was shocked--not only by this brutality, but by the speed with which Alexander and his army had moved. There was no further thought of rebellion in Greece, as the city-states hastened to proclaim their loyalty to the new Macedonian king.</STRING>

Caravans of camels crisscrossed the Arabian desert, carrying these precious spices to Europe and to North Africa and returning laden with gold and other valuables. Those familiar with the story of the legendary Queen of Sheba might note that another name for her homeland was Saba. The Romans called this region "Arabia Felix," which translates as "Happy Arabia." The term was a reflection of the prosperity of the people from their spice production and trade.<SPACE/>Although Alexander never found the time to conquer or explore this region in depth, he would certainly have been aware of its wealth and strategic value.</STRING>

Less than a century before, during the Peloponnesian Wars, the Syracusans had destroyed the power of Athens and its allies during the latter's ill-fated attempt to capture the Greco-Italian city.</STRING>

		<ENTRY name="BATTLE OF THE NILE">
			<STRING>This scenario focuses upon Alexander's conquest of Egypt and his founding of the great seaport that still bears his name. Alexander the Great entered Egypt without opposition in 332 B.C. He was welcomed (for the most part) as a liberator by the Egyptians, who were heartily sick of 200 years of repressive Persian rule. It is said that when Alexander met the Persian governor of Egypt, Mazaces, the latter gave Alexander not only a huge amount of gold, but also "all the royal furniture."<SPACE/>Alexander remained in Egypt for a mere six months, yet this brief visit made a lasting impression upon the country, and upon history. During the years 332-331 B.C., the city of Alexandria was constructed on the site of a village called Rhakotis. Alexandria was to become renowned for its famous library, which was said by ancient historians to contain up to half a million scrolls.<SPACE/>While in Egypt, Alexander made a legendary trek across the desert, under the burning sun and through fierce sandstorms, to the Oasis at Siwa to consult with the oracle there. All were astonished that he even survived the journey. But "Fortune, by giving in to him on every occasion, had made his resolve unshakable and so he was able to overcome not only his enemies, but even places and seasons of the year," according to the Greek historian Plutarch.</STRING>

		<ENTRY name="BATTLE AT THE CILICIAN GATES">
			<STRING>The Cilician Gates (known today as Gülek Boğazi) is a key pass through the Taurus Mountains of what is now Turkey. Armies going from the Anatolian plateau in the north to the Cilician plains in the south had to pass through the Gates. Due to the steep and rugged nature of the mountains on either side, it was said that the Gates were so narrow that no more than one cart could pass through them at a time. <SPACE/>Although this may be an exaggeration, had Darius defended the Gates even a small, determined force could have blocked Alexander's passage toward Syria and the Persian homeland for a long time. But Darius did not. Upon hearing of Alexander's approach, the Persian troops assigned to the defense of the Cilician Gates fled, and the road south was open. </STRING>
		</ENTRY>
		<ENTRY name="BATTLE AT HALICARNASSUS">
			<STRING>Halicarnassus, an ancient city, is today known as Bodrum. It was here that the famous Greek historian Herodotus was born. Its famous Mausoleum, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, was built by the city's Queen Artemisia II to honor her deceased husband King Mausolos (hence the origin of the word "mausoleum"). It was 140 feet in height. <SPACE/>During the time of Alexander, Halicarnassus was an important coastal fortress and naval base. In 334 B.C., when Alexander and his army arrived at Halicarnassus, it was surrounded by imposing defenses, including many towers and all manner of ancient artillery. Alexander would not have an easy fight to take the city. And because of the wealth and importance of Halicarnassus, Alexander did his best at the outset to encourage the inhabitants to surrender, as he did not want to damage the city. By the time Halicarnassus fell, however, either Alexander or his men had changed their tune, for much of the city was sacked and burned, with only the famous Mausoleum escaping serious damage. </STRING>
		</ENTRY>
		<ENTRY name="BATTLE AT THE GRANICUS">
			<STRING>History, or perhaps legend, tells us that when Alexander sailed his army across the narrow straits of the Hellespont in 334 BC, he hurled a spear from his ship to the beach. Leaping ashore, he pulled the spear out of the ground, declaring that the whole of Asia would be his prize from the gods, and that it would be won by the spear. He was soon to have an opportunity to test his prediction.<SPACE/>When Alexander first intruded onto Persian soil, Darius, the Great King of Persia did not take the Macedonian army terribly seriously. He ignored the advice of his Greek mercenary general, Memnon. Memnon knew the power of the Macedonian phalanx all too well and counseled a strategy that included retreat and a scorched earth policy as the Persians waited to gather more troops.<SPACE/>Instead, Darius sent a fairly small army (for the Persians), composed mostly of conscripts and untrained levies, to await Alexander not far from the shores of the Hellespont on the far bank of the river Granicus.<SPACE/>The Granicus was swift, and its banks were steep, and his general Parmenio advised Alexander that it would be unwise to attempt a crossing. Alexander’s reply, according to the Greek historian Plutarch, was that, "he should disgrace the Hellespont, should he fear the Granicus." And so saying, Alexander plunged into the river, closely followed by his cavalry.<SPACE/>Granicus was Alexander's first battle, and according to some accounts, the one where he came closest to being killed, and also to being defeated. Engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat through much of the day, Alexander personally killed the Persian cavalry commander, Mithradates, and was wounded at least once during the battle.<SPACE/>The victory at Granicus liberated the Greek cities along the coast of Asia Minor from Persian rule, and also served notice to Darius that here was an enemy to be reckoned with.</STRING>
		</ENTRY>
		<ENTRY name="BATTLE OF ISSUS">
			<STRING>After forcing the Cilician Gates, Alexander and his army advanced boldly deep into Persian territory. Alexander and his generals, who had probably grown a bit complacent at this point after so many errors by their foes, were astonished to learn that, rather than being some distance in front of them, Darius and his huge, lumbering army had gotten behind the Macedonians and were at Issus, astride Alexander's line of supply. <SPACE/>It is unclear how many men Darius actually had to face Alexander's 31,000 or so, but even the smallest estimate is that the Persian forces numbered twice that of the Macedonians. And the troops available to Darius included thousands of tough, well-trained Greek mercenaries who knew their fate would be death if Alexander captured them, as he had already demonstrated how he would deal with such "traitors." <SPACE/>The battle was fought with the Macedonians' left flank anchored by the sea. To Alexander’s right, there were mountains which were occupied by Persian light infantry. The two armies were divided by the river Pinarus. Alexander's troops drove the Persians off, and Darius fled the field. Both sides suffered heavy losses, though the Persians far more so. In addition, Alexander captured the wife and children of Darius. <SPACE/>After the battle, Darius sent a series of letters to Alexander, offering the latter huge amounts of gold for the return of his family, as well as all of the Persian Empire west of the Euphrates. Alexander discussed this offer with Parmenio, one of his most trusted and successful generals. "I would accept it," said Parmenio after hearing of Darius’ offer. "If I were Alexander." <SPACE/>"So would I," was the response. "If I were Parmenio." </STRING>
		</ENTRY>
		<ENTRY name="BATTLE OF GAUGAMELA">
			<STRING>The Battle of Gaugamela was fought at the beginning of October in 331 B.C. It was the last--and greatest--of the battles between Alexander and the great Persian king, Darius. Some 47,000 troops under Alexander met a force estimated by ancient chroniclers at more than a million (but only a bit more than a tenth that number by modern historians). Gaugamela was a vast, flat plain that had been cleared by the Persians to make the terrain as ideal as possible for their numerous chariots and cavalry. For the first time, Darius had some 50 Indian elephants and a force of chariots, which had been lent to him by his Indian allies. <SPACE/>Darius placed himself in the center of the Persian line with his best heavy infantry; Alexander was on the Greek right with his Companions, as usual. The powerful phalanxes were in the Macedonian center. It was apparently the Persian intention to use their overwhelming numbers to envelop the much smaller Macedonian forces and crush them from flank and rear. <SPACE/>The Macedonian infantry advanced toward the center, seemingly oblivious to the Persian intentions. Then Alexander's entire army began to move on the oblique to the right, away from the trap and the battlefield the Persians had so carefully sculpted. <SPACE/>Alexander and his Companions surged through a gap in the Persian line, with the Macedonian king serving as the tip of a spear aimed directly at Darius himself. Darius once again fled the battlefield, hotly pursued by the horsemen of Alexander. But it was not the Macedonians who caught him; Darius was caught and murdered by Bessus, one of his generals, who in turn was later executed by Alexander. </STRING>

		<ENTRY name="SAMNITE WAR">
			<STRING>Historically, Alexander never fought the Samnites, which might have been just as well. They were a hardy, tough tribe of mountain warriors who resided in the Apennine Mountains of central and southern Italy. It took the Romans over 50 years and three wars to subdue the Samnites. It was during the second of these wars (which lasted from 326-304 B.C.--22 years!) that Rome suffered one of the most humiliating defeats in her history: at the battle of the Caudine Forks (321 B.C.), an entire Roman army was forced to surrender. <SPACE/>History records that the flexible manipular, or checkerboard, formation that contributed to the Roman legion’s military dominance in Europe for over 1,100 years was borrowed by the Romans from the Samnites. </STRING>

		<ENTRY name="MAGADHA">
			<STRING>East of the Indian kingdom ruled by Porus was the ancient and powerful kingdom of Magadha. Since he had not conquered quite the entire world yet, Alexander decided to add Magadha to his tally. When the Macedonian army reached the River Hyphasis (near the modern city of Lahore, in Pakistan), however, his men mutinied. They had had enough of Alexander's ambition, and had marched enough over thousands of miles, they felt, to satisfy his lust for conquest and victory. Magadha was not part of the Persian Empire they had agreed to conquer, and they reminded Alexander of his many previous promises that they would eventually be able to go home. In addition, an eclipse of the moon was taken as an evil omen. <SPACE/>Sometime during his sojourn in India, Alexander conversed with a group of Brahmin priests. Their leader, Dandamis, told Alexander that although the latter insisted he had been sent by the gods to conquer the lands of the Indians, "You will soon be dead, and then you will own just as much of this earth as will suffice to bury you." </STRING>
		</ENTRY>
		<ENTRY name="MAURYA AND MAGADHA">
			<STRING>When Alexander wheeled his army around and started marching westward, never to return, he left Macedonian garrisons behind him in India and elsewhere. Their presence was deeply offensive to the ancient civilization already located in these areas, and there were numerous uprisings. During this period a new leader arose, Chandragupta Maurya. The son of a king of Magadha who had been driven into exile, Chandragupta (also known as Mura, and as Sandracottus by the Greeks) had in fact met with Alexander and attempted to persuade him to invade his homeland to restore Chandragupta to the throne.<SPACE/>This did not happen, but eventually Chandragupta returned and conquered the Magadha kingdom. Later, his son and grandson united nearly all of India under one rule for the first time in its history.</STRING>

While some of the troops marched south, he sailed down the river to where it joined the Indus, fighting the locals the entire length of the journey. Alexander was badly wounded while storming one city along the route. For several days his men were terrified that he would die, and that subsequently they would never find their way back to Macedonia. They did, however, eventually make it to the banks of the Indus, where Nearchus took the bulk of the army onto the ships, and Alexander and the rest of his troops began their epic trek across the Gedrosian Desert.</STRING>

Alexander’s only recourse was to kill Bessus, who was hiding out in Bactria.<SPACE/>Bessus sent his armies, led by Spitamenes and Oxyartes and composed of Bactrians and Soghdians, to face off with Alexander. However, Bessus was unable to foresee the speed with which Alexander's army covered distances, and Alexander was able to outflank the force sent at him.<SPACE/>At this point, Bessus fled north across the Oxus River to Soghdiana, where he could use attrition as his best defense. But Bessus again misjudged Alexander. Alexander crossed the Oxus with such great speed that Spitamenes and the Soghdian barons panicked, which led them to depose Bessus.<SPACE/>Alexander then arranged for a meeting between himself and Spitamenes, but Spitamenes was wary of becoming a hostage to Alexander and refused to show up. Instead, he led a rebellion against Alexander.<SPACE/>After a humiliating defeat by Alexander's general Coenus, the Soghdian rebels turned on Spitamenes and sent his head to Alexander as a peace offering. This left only the independent Soghdian barons for Alexander to deal with. The first of these was Oxyartes, whose mountain stronghold was known as the Soghdian Rock.<SPACE/>Knowing that there was no way for Alexander to breach his walls, Oxyartes declared he would yield only to winged soldiers. Alexander took him up on this offer, and sent some of his men to climb a mountain that overlooked Oxyartes' stronghold. With Alexander's soldiers waving and cheering from above, Oxyartes was forced to sign a peace treaty with Alexander. The rest of the barons soon followed suit, and Alexander ended up taking Oxyartes daughter, Roxanne, as his first wife.</STRING>

		<ENTRY name="CAPTURE DARIUS">
			<STRING>After Alexander captured the Persian capital of Persepolis, Darius fled quickly towards Bactria, another seat of power for the Persians. Alexander followed, stopping at the city of Ecbatana in the province of Media. He did not waste much time there, as he knew he had to overtake Darius before Darius fled through the Caspian Gates.<SPACE/>Before Alexander set out, however, he learned that Darius had not only made it through the Caspian Gates, but had been deposed by his lieutenant Bessus, Satrap of Bactria. Bessus followed this action by declaring himself the Great King and taking the name Artaxerxes.<SPACE/>Darius was not killed right away, as Bessus was afraid of defeat by Alexander and thought that having Darius captive would provide him with a bargaining chip.<SPACE/>However, Alexander learned of the village in which Darius was being held and made a mad dash with a few troops to capture him. Although Alexander did not have enough of an army to defeat the troops holding Darius, the enemy fled, leaving behind a dying Darius.</STRING>

		<ENTRY name="BARBARIANS OF ILLYRIA">
			<STRING>Ancient Thrace occupied most of the area known today as the nation of Bulgaria, as well as parts of other countries, including Greece, Turkey, and Romania. It was a densely-populated state for its time; during the era of Alexander, there may have been a million Thracians while the population of the Greek city-states numbered no more than 250,000. Herodotus, the Greek historian who is known alternately as “the Father of History” and "the Father of Lies," was from Thrace. Probably the most famous Thracian was Spartacus, who precipitated a revolt of Roman slaves in 73 B.C. that threatened to topple the powerful Roman republic. <SPACE/>In war, Thracians were noted for their courage and resourcefulness, and Thracian peltasts were prized as mercenary soldiers for centuries. By the end of 342 B.C., Alexander's father, Philip II, had conquered all of Thrace. It was conquered again by the Romans in 46 B.C., in the campaign in which Spartacus was captured. The bulk of Thrace was assimilated into Bulgaria in the seventh century. </STRING>

		<ENTRY name="MEGALE HELLAS">
			<STRING>Megale Hellas, later known to the Romans as Magna Graecia ("Greater Greece"), was the region of southern Italy and Sicily that was heavily populated by Greeks. Starting in the 8th century B.C., Greek colonists founded a number of great cities on the Italian islands and mainland, including Syracuse, Gela, Selinus, Reggio, Taranto, and Naples, among others.<SPACE/>Although not necessarily keen to become subjects of Alexander, the large number of ethnic Greeks living in Italy would have had no great love for their erstwhile homeland, either. Less than a century before, during the Peloponnesian Wars, the Syracusans had destroyed the power of Athens and its allies during the latter's ill-fated attempt to capture the Greco-Italian city.</STRING>

			<STRING>The Greeks first became aware of Alexander--or at least were affected by his presence--when he led a Macedonian cavalry charge at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 B.C. when he was only eighteen. He broke the famous Sacred Band of Thebes which, according to legend, was the first time anybody had ever dared to charge horsemen against them. His success helped his father Philip II defeat the Athenians and their allies and establish Macedonian rule over Greece.<SPACE/>When Philip died in 336 B.C., the Greek city-states that he had conquered rejoiced, certain that this event portended the end of Macedonian rule of Greece. There was little belief that a mere boy (as the Greeks perceived Alexander) would be able to hold together the empire that Philip had forged.<SPACE/>The Athenians, the Aetolians, the Thebans, the Spartans and other Peloponnesians, were all more than ready to declare their independence. Alexander knew that he had to act swiftly to prevent the dissolution of his extended realm. A false rumor spread through Greece like wildfire that Alexander had died at the hands of Illyrian rebels, and the Thebans rose in revolt. Athens and the other Greek city-states, though sympathetic to Thebes, waited to see what Alexander would do.<SPACE/>What he did was to embark upon a lightning campaign, marching his forces almost 240 miles in 14 days, to appear before the gates of rebellious Thebes. Thebes stood defiant, refusing to surrender, so Alexander sacked the city, killing or enslaving its more than 30,000 inhabitants.<SPACE/>Civilized Greece was shocked--not only by this brutality, but by the speed with which Alexander and his army had moved.

			<BULLET/>The Macedonian Political Situation<SPACE/>Alexander was born in 356 B.C. the son of Philip, king of Macedonia and his queen, Olympias, the daughter of the king of Epirus. From the beginning Olympias, who was mentally unbalanced to the point of being consumed by mystery religions, was jealous of Philip’s success and protective of her son's right to succeed as King of Macedonia.<SPACE/>Olympias's religious passions and her inability to accept Philip’s infidelities led to an estrangement between her and the king. Philip was frustrated and angered by Olympias’s strange interests as well as her refusal to accept his infidelities. Because of this, Alexander’s parents were soon bitterly parted. Even so, Philip always considered Alexander his son and heir and to prepare him to succeed he employed the greatest philosopher of the era, Aristotle, as his tutor.<SPACE/>Things came to a head when in 337 B.C., Philip divorced Olympias and married a native Macedonian, Cleopatra, the niece of one of his generals, Attalus. Olympias retreated to her native Epirus. At the wedding Alexander and Philip had a confrontation during which Alexander taunted his father as being incompetent. Shortly thereafter, though not shortly enough to prevent Cleopatra from getting pregnant, Philip was assassinated at the wedding of his daughter.<SPACE/>Alexander became king and his mother returned from Epirus. Shorty thereafter Cleopatra and her child were killed at the order of Olympias. That which Philip began Alexander would finish and the world would never be the same.<SPACE/>
			<BULLET/>The Macedonian Military System<SPACE/>Philip was a political and military genius. He created the military machine that first allowed him to consolidate his political base in Macedonia, then to defeat the league of Greek city-states, which attempted to resist his desire to unite Greece under his rule.<SPACE/>The military machine consisted of a backbone of deep infantry formations known as phalanxes. These formations were inspired by the Greek phalanx, which was eight ranks deep and 256 files wide. In Philip’s system a Macedonian phalanx consisted of twelve sytagma of sixteen ranks by sixteen files or 3,072 phalangites formed in a more flexible formation than the Greek phalanx ever achieved.<SPACE/>To this backbone of heavy infantry was added a corps of hypaspists, armed more lightly than that phalangites, but more heavily than peltasts, or light infantry. The hydaspist units were deployed to protect the vulnerable flanks of the phalanx.<SPACE/>In addition, Philip developed a corps of heavy cavalry designed for “shock” action. Under Alexander, these were later to be known as the Companions, as they served as his bodyguard on the battlefield, and followed him into the thickest of the fighting. And thick it was – Alexander was wounded eight times in one battle alone, fighting against the Malli in 326 B.C.<SPACE/>Finally, there were mercenary units of slingers and javelin men. All of this lent flexibility to the Macedonian army, which the armies of the Greek city-states or of Persia or India, did not have.</ENTRY>
