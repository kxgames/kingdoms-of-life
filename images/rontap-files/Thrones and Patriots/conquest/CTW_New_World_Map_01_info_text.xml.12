			<STRING>In the summer of 1781, after more than six years of war, the American army under the command of General George Washington trapped the forces of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, a small town on the banks of the York River, in Virginia. Washington's army of more than 17,000 troops, including a large French contingent under Count Rochambeau, vastly outnumbered Cornwallis' 8300 British, German, and Loyalist troops. A French fleet under Admiral de Grasse completed the encirclement by blockading the mouth of the Chesapeake, which prevented British reinforcements and supplies from coming into Yorktown and Cornwallis and his army from escaping. <SPACE/>On October 19, 1781, Cornwallis surrendered. As his defeated troops marched out to surrender their arms, a British band played a popular tune of the time, "The World Turned Upside Down"--as surely it must have seemed to these proud, seldom-defeated professional soldiers.</STRING>

		<ENTRY name="THE PLAINS">
			<STRING>The Great Plains, a sea of grassland stretching for more than 500 miles from the Midwestern United States and Canada to the Rocky Mountains, was inhabited by Native Americans for many centuries before the Europeans arrived. Becoming nomadic hunters once they acquired horses, the inhabitants of the Plains were among the finest horsemen in the world. Once this region was settled by Europeans and the buffalo were nearly exterminated by over-hunting, settlers discovered that the Great Plains was also one of the richest crop-growing areas in the world.</STRING>

		<ENTRY name="YUCATAN">
			<STRING>The Mayans did not comprise one unified empire as is commonly thought, but rather a collection of independent states with a common cultural and religious background. There were as many as twenty Mayan states located on and around the Yucatan Peninsula. <SPACE/>Mayan religion was composed of a repeating cycle of ceremonies. These ceremonies involved dancing, performances, prayer, and sacrifice. The majority of these sacrifices involved human blood. The Mayan priests would voluntarily pierce themselves and let their blood flow onto the temple. The higher the position a priest held in society, the more blood was expected. Some ceremonies demanded the still-beating heart of a human sacrifice. The priest would make an incision below the rib cage and rip out the heart of the sacrifice. <SPACE/>The heart was then burned. The Mayans fled or gave up their cities around 900 A.D. No one knows for certain why they did this; the exodus may have been caused by famine, warfare, or religious motivation. They left behind few records, and the records that did survive the collapse of their civilization were destroyed as heretical nonsense by the Spanish Conquistadors. All that is certain is that one of the most advanced civilizations of the time collapsed suddenly and inexplicably.</STRING>

		<ENTRY name="PERU">
			<STRING>The Inca Empire was the largest Native American state ever to exist. At its peak, it was the largest nation on the planet, with a 14,000-mile network of paved roads, and more than 10 million inhabitants spread over a domain that stretched 2,500 miles, from modern Chile to Colombia. <SPACE/>"The riches that were gathered in the city of Cuzco alone, as capital and court of the Empire, were incredible," said a Spanish priest who visited the Inca capital soon after it was conquered by the Spanish. This was due in part to the custom of the Inca rulers of leaving the homes and treasures of each previous ruler intact and undisturbed once they died, so the city was filled with splendid, empty palaces.  Soon enough, however, most of these riches were shipped back to Spain, and the Inca Empire's cities and culture lay in ruins.</STRING>

		<ENTRY name="TECHNOTITLAN">
			<STRING>The Aztecs created one of the two greatest empires of the ancient Americas (the other being that of the Inca). The Aztec armies, at least until they found themselves facing the gunpowder and horses of the Spaniards, were well-drilled, courageous, and utterly ruthless. Enemies who were not killed outright were captured for later sacrifice. <SPACE/>Although ultimately defeated by the Spanish army under Cortes, the Aztecs did have their successes. Notable among these was the so-called Noche Triste (“sad night”) of June 30, 1520, during which the residents of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan rose up against the Spaniards and drove them out of the city altogether, killing two-thirds of the Spanish soldiers and about a thousand of their Tlaxcalan allies during the rout. <SPACE/>"In our company was a soldier called Botello," wrote one survivor years later, "who seemed a very decent man and knew Latin and had been in Rome. Some said that he had a familiar spirit, others called him an astrologer. Now, four days before, this Botello had claimed to have learnt, by casting lots or by astrology, that if we did not leave Mexico on that particular night, but delayed our departure, not one of us would escape with his life." </STRING>

			<STRING>The Iroquois, originally known as the Five Nations (before they were joined by additional tribes), were spread across the region occupied by the Great Lakes. In addition to being excellent hunters, the Iroquois were also first-rate farmers. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Iroquois were usually allied with the English against the French and their Native American allies, the Huron and the Algonquin. The Great Lakes were the great prize in this struggle, as they not only served as a huge highway into the interior of North America, but the surrounding shores were rich with animals such as the beaver and bear, whose pelts were greatly prized in Europe.</STRING>

		<ENTRY name="PIRATE STORM">
			<STRING>As long as there have been vessels that have gone to sea carrying valuables, there have been pirates attempting to steal them. In the Americas, pirates were a particular scourge of the Spanish because of the heavily-laden treasure ships they sent back to Europe from Mexico and the Caribbean twice a year. The 17th and 18th centuries, when these fleets were at their largest and wealthiest, were, not surprisingly, known as the "Golden Age of Piracy." Of course, the pirates' victims probably had other labels.<SPACE/>Since they were subject to arrest, imprisonment, and execution if their ships entered respectable ports to refit and recruit, most pirates either had their own secret bases among the thousands of islands of the Caribbean, or sailed into ports known to be havens for their type. These included the islands of Guadeloupe, West Hispaniola, Tortuga (now Haiti), and Nassau in the Bahamas. Without a doubt the most famous--and most lawless--pirate base was Port Royale, on the island of Jamaica. In June 1692, without any warning, Port Royale, known at the time as "the wickedest city on Earth," suffered a great earthquake, and most of the city sank beneath the water within minutes, killing many pirates and citizens.<SPACE/>"Those who have perpetrated these crimes call the uninhabited places 'peaceful'," wrote one Spanish visitor in 1557.

Columbus wrote that all of the native peoples he had met in this region were greatly afraid of them. The Spanish considered the Caribs, and their customs, to be quite barbaric. On the other hand, the European colonists virtually wiped out the indigenous peoples of the islands via warfare, slavery, and the diseases they brought with them from Europe.<SPACE/>"Those who have perpetrated these crimes call the uninhabited places 'peaceful'," wrote one Spanish visitor in 1557.

The Amazon runs for more than 4,000 miles from the mountains of the Andes in the west, across the length of Brazil, and then into the Atlantic Ocean. The name of the river has its origin in the ancient Greek legends of a tribe of fierce women called the Amazons, who were said to live along the shores of the Black Sea.  <SPACE/>In 1542, the Spanish conquistador Francisco de Orellana and his men became the first Europeans to journey the length of the Amazon. During their travels, they were attacked by a native tribe of women warriors, each of whom was capable of, in the words of Orellana, "doing as much fighting as ten men." As a result of several encounters with these warriors, Orellana gave the river the name "Amazonas."</STRING>

			<STRING>When the first European colonists came to the Americas, they may have been in search of gold or other valuable resources, but they soon discovered that their most pressing need was for food. Although there was food in abundance, much of it was in a form previously unknown to them. Without the assistance of the local Native Americans, some of the colonies almost certainly would have not survived. <SPACE/>For example, take the Pilgrims of New Massachusetts who, according to popular legend, landed at Plymouth Rock in November 1620, too late for either planting or harvesting. That first winter was a cold, hard one, and food was in very short supply. As it was, even with the help of the Native Americans, less than 50 (i.e., not quite half) of the original colonists survived the winter. </STRING>

		<ENTRY name="FEDERATION">
			<STRING>It was not at all uncommon for disparate tribes of Native Americans to fight either against one another, or against the ever-westward encroachments of the Europeans. One example, the Iroquois, was not a tribe, but rather a confederation of six powerful Native American nations: the Seneca, Mohawk, Cayuga, Oneida, Onondaga, and Huron. It has been said that their model was one that inspired the original framers of the American Articles of Confederation (which eventually led to the creation of the U.S. Constitution). The Iroquois nation (which later included the Tuscarora) was huge, its loose boundaries reached from southern Canada to Kentucky, and from New York and Pennsylvania to Ohio. <SPACE/>A later example of such a federation was that of the Sioux, Cheyenne, and several smaller nations who came together in 1876 and formed an army of more than 2,500 warriors (a huge number for a people who usually raided in bands of 100 or less). They destroyed the column of U.S. cavalry troops led into their territory by Colonel George Armstrong Custer. </STRING>

Instead, by the end of that summer Cornwallis found himself pinned and unable to escape the town of Yorktown on the York River. He had been led to believe that, were he to get to the river, the Royal Navy would at least be able to supply and reinforce his troops, and at best carry them off to New York or elsewhere. <SPACE/>Instead, at the notable Battle of the Chesapeake, the Royal Navy suffered one of its very few major naval defeats of this era, leaving Cornwallis and his 8,300 men trapped and ultimately forced to surrender to General George Washington.</STRING>

			<STRING>Compared to most European nations, the British were latecomers to the New World. They had found pirating Spanish ships to be much more profitable than establishing a colony of their own. England was not as wealthy as other nations, and with new advances in agriculture, the country was becoming overburdened with a rising urban population. <SPACE/>To solve both problems at once, Queen Elizabeth encouraged groups of investors to finance colonies in the New World and offered the lower class population opportunities to own their own plots of land. Many of the early attempts failed, and there was no gold to be had from the North American coast as the Portuguese and Spanish had found further south. <SPACE/>In the early 1600s, Christian separatists fled England and settled in the New World. As Britain’s hold on lands that would become American began to fail, they took France’s colonies in the north by force. Shortly after seizing the Canadian provinces from France, Britain was faced with the American Revolution; thus they ended up losing one area of the New World and gaining another. </STRING>

An unexpected change in the ships' route forced them to cross the Atlantic and they arrived in a new "uncharted" land, which they immediately claimed for Portugal. It later was named Brazil due to the abundance of brazilwood in the area. <SPACE/>Early trading posts slowly became settlements and sugarcane farms. The Portuguese colonists had a huge area to explore and defend against other European nations. Many expeditions went to explore the interior, following rumors of gold deposits and searching for natives to enslave. These expeditions were led by a mix of mercenary soldiers and explorers.

		<ENTRY name="INTRO_TEXT">In the early 16th century the populations of Europe were expanding rapidly and the Crowns were looking for new opportunities to increase their treasuries. Thus began the Age of Exploration. Several explorers left Europe looking for riches in Asia. When Christopher Columbus set off for the East Indies and instead stumbled upon two previously unknown continents, the nations of Europe immediately began sending emissaries to exploit these discoveries.<SPACE/>The American continents were not unknown to everyone. There had been people living there for thousands of years. These peoples had built their own empires and established their own nations. Some were farmers and others were warriors. None were prepared for the onslaught of foreigners that plagued their lands.<SPACE/>The Spanish had the early edge because they had discovered these lands before the other nations of Europe. They quickly increased their influence in Central America. Although the Spanish were firmly entrenched in the Caribbean, the other nations of Europe, mainly the British, quickly caught up the to the Spanish by establishing colonies in North America.<SPACE/>The French established colonies in the Carribbean as well as in North America. However, these paled in comparison to the colonies of the other nations. Eventually the French could no longer afford to support their colonies and ceded or sold them to other nations.<SPACE/>The Portuguese and Dutch sailed to South America and established trading posts to acquire the unique resources of the Amazonian jungle. They were also quick to recognize the potential of sugar plantations in this large and sparsely inhabited region.<SPACE/>The Aztec and Incan nations were large and powerful when the Spanish first landed on their coasts. The Aztecs had subjugated most of Mexico and ruled with an iron hand. The Incans had built a massive empire in South America and accumulated immense amounts of wealth.<SPACE/>The Mayan civilization was in decline at this time. They had never been composed of a centralized nation but were instead made up of several large and powerful city states. In the late 10th century many of these cities collapsed and were lost.
